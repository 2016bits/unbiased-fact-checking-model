Experts from the Mongolian Grass Ecosystem Positioning Research Station at the Chinese Academy of Sciences say that the net fence will play an important role not only in the conservation of biodiversity, but rather in the ecological preservation of the grasslands. Since the net fence is not merely a net but rather a strip, it will have little impact on the biological phenomena such as the spread of plant pollen, which is just like the trenches of the fields, rather than an ecological killer, and that the fence will need to be increased in accordance with the reality."

        "translated_evidence": "1) First of all, the logical problem is that more people have been vaccinated than infected, and more and more have been vaccinated with time. Of course, more and more people have been diagnosed with the disease. This is a theoretical fiction, and there is no guarantee that the vaccine will not be infected. (2) The data currently analysed from the United States CDC show that, after five months, more breakthrough infections than within five months of the BNT vaccine (approximately 4 per cent compared to 1.1 per cent above) require further exploration; and it appears from the data in Israel that the rate of serious illness with the vaccine is much smaller than age, and the difference between age and age is more obvious [3]."

        "evidence": "据银行业务人士透露，频繁查询征信记录对于客户信用评估会造成一定影响，一般情况下，银行未经客户许可不会私查征信，通常会在贷前、贷中及贷后监管环节进行查询，但不会过于频繁；不过具体操作中，确实存在一些操作不太合规的情况。 银行可能通过查看借款人的信用报告查询次数，判断借款人是否存在急于借款、多头借贷等情况。 如果因审查客户的融资申请产生的查询记录次数过多，则会对申请银行贷款有影响。 一般来说，一段时间内，个人征信报告因贷款、信用卡审批等原因被不同机构多次查询，但征信报告却显示该段时间内用户没有成功获批新贷款或成功申请到信用卡，那么，银行有理由推测该用户财务状况不佳，从而拒绝用户的申贷请求。 不过，信用报告只是作为银行放贷的一个参考，是否放贷还是取决于银行对客户情况的综合考量。 ",

Banks may have reason to suspect that the borrower is in a bad financial position to refuse a loan request."
